# Git for DevOps: A Comprehensive Guide

This guide provides a compact yet comprehensive overview of Git, tailored specifically for DevOps engineers. It covers essential concepts and commands needed for version control, collaboration, and infrastructure as code (IaC) workflows.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is a system that tracks changes to a set of files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate effectively. In DevOps, it's crucial for managing code, configurations, and infrastructure definitions.

## Why Git?

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS), meaning each developer has a full copy of the repository and its history. This offers several advantages:

*   **Offline Work:** Commit changes even without an internet connection.
*   **Branching:** Experiment with new features and fixes in isolation.
*   **Collaboration:** Easily share and merge changes with others.
*   **History:** Track the evolution of your code and configurations.

## Core Concepts

1.  **Repository (.git directory):** The heart of Git, storing the history, objects, and metadata. Created using `git init`.

2.  **Working Directory:** The local directory where you work on your files.

3.  **Staging Area (Index):** A holding area where you prepare changes for the next commit.

4.  **Commit:** A snapshot of the repository at a specific point in time, with a unique commit hash. Think of it as a version save.

5.  **Branch:** A lightweight, movable pointer to a commit. Used for isolating changes and parallel development.

6.  **Merge:** Combining changes from one branch into another.

7.  **Remote Repository:** A repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) for collaboration and backups.

## Essential Git Commands

### 1. Initialization and Setup

*   **`git init`:** Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
    ```bash
    mkdir my-devops-project
    cd my-devops-project
    git init
    ```
*   **`git config`:** Configures Git settings.
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    git config --global core.editor "nano" # or vim, etc.
    ```

### 2. Staging and Committing

*   **`git status`:** Shows the status of the working directory and staging area.
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
*   **`git add`:** Adds changes from the working directory to the staging area.
    ```bash
    git add <file>      # Add a specific file
    git add .         # Add all changes in the current directory
    ```
*   **`git commit`:** Creates a new commit with the staged changes.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Commit message describing changes"
    ```
    *   **Best Practice: Commit Message Format**
        *   Concise subject line (50 characters or less).
        *   Descriptive body (if needed) explaining the *why* behind the changes.
        *   Use the imperative mood ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").

*   **`.gitignore`:** Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., logs, build artifacts).
    ```text
    # Example .gitignore
    *.log
    /build/
    .DS_Store
    ```

### 3. Exploring History

*   **`git log`:** Shows the commit history.
    ```bash
    git log                  # Basic log output
    git log --oneline         # Concise one-line output
    git log --graph          # Visualize branches
    git log --graph --oneline --decorate # A useful combo
    git log --author="Your Name" # Filter by author
    git log -p                 # Show diffs for each commit
    git log --since="2 weeks ago" # Filter by time
    ```

*   **`git show`:** Shows the details of a specific commit.
    ```bash
    git show <commit_hash>
    ```

### 4. Branching and Merging

*   **`git branch`:** Manages branches (create, list, delete).
    ```bash
    git branch <branch_name>     # Create a new branch
    git branch                   # List local branches
    git branch -a                # List all branches (local and remote)
    git branch -d <branch_name>  # Delete a local branch (if merged)
    git branch -D <branch_name>  # Force delete a local branch (even if not merged)
    ```

*   **`git checkout`:** Switches between branches.
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch_name>    # Switch to an existing branch
    git checkout -b <branch_name> # Create and switch to a new branch
    ```

*   **`git merge`:** Merges changes from one branch into another.
    ```bash
    git checkout main         # Switch to the target branch
    git merge <branch_name>   # Merge changes from <branch_name> into main
    ```

*   **Merge Conflicts:** Occur when Git cannot automatically merge changes.
    *   Git marks conflicted files with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` markers.
    *   Manually resolve conflicts by editing the file, choosing the desired changes.
    *   After resolving, `git add <file>` and `git commit` to complete the merge.

### 5. Remote Repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

*   **`git remote`:** Manages remote repositories.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <remote_url> # Add a remote repository (often called "origin")
    git remote -v                    # List remote repositories (verbose)
    ```

*   **`git clone`:** Clones a remote repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <remote_url>
    ```

*   **`git push`:** Pushes local commits to a remote repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin <branch_name>  # Push local branch to remote
    git push -u origin <branch_name> # Set up tracking for future pushes/pulls
    ```

*   **`git pull`:** Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into your local branch.
    ```bash
    git pull origin <branch_name>
    ```

### 6. Undoing Changes

*   **`git checkout`:** Can revert changes to a specific file in the working directory.
    ```bash
    git checkout <commit_hash> <file> # Revert a file to a previous commit
    git checkout .                   # Discard all changes in the working directory
    ```

*   **`git reset`:** Moves the commit pointer (rewrites history - use with caution on shared branches!).
    ```bash
    git reset --soft <commit_hash>  # Move pointer, keep changes staged
    git reset --mixed <commit_hash> # Move pointer, unstage changes
    git reset --hard <commit_hash> # Move pointer, discard changes (DANGEROUS)
    ```

    *   **Important:** Avoid `git reset --hard` on shared branches! Use `git revert` instead.
*   **`git revert`:** Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.
    ```bash
    git revert <commit_hash>
    ```

## DevOps Workflows with Git

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow

*   **DevOps Use Case:** Developing new features, isolating changes, and code review.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a new branch for the feature: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
    2.  Make changes, staging and committing them regularly.
    3.  Push the branch to the remote repository: `git push origin feature/new-feature`
    4.  Create a Pull Request (PR) on the remote repository for code review.
    5.  Review and discuss the changes in the PR.
    6.  Merge the PR into the main branch.
    7.  Delete the feature branch: `git branch -d feature/new-feature` (local), `git push origin --delete feature/new-feature` (remote)

### 2. Bug Fix Workflow

*   **DevOps Use Case:** Fixing bugs quickly and efficiently.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a bug fix branch from the main branch: `git checkout -b bugfix/fix-issue`
    2.  Fix the bug, staging and committing the changes.
    3.  Push the branch to the remote repository: `git push origin bugfix/fix-issue`
    4.  Create a PR on the remote repository.
    5.  Review and merge the PR into the main branch.
    6.  Consider cherry-picking or merging the fix into other relevant branches (e.g., release branches).

### 3. Hotfix Workflow

*   **DevOps Use Case:** Addressing critical issues in production.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a hotfix branch from a release tag: `git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue <release_tag>`
    2.  Fix the bug, staging and committing the changes.
    3.  Push the branch to the remote repository: `git push origin hotfix/critical-issue`
    4.  Create a PR on the remote repository.
    5.  Review and merge the PR into both the release branch and the main branch.
    6.  Create a new tag for the hotfix release.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Git

*   **DevOps Use Case:** Storing infrastructure configurations (Terraform, Ansible, etc.) in Git.
*   **Best Practices:**
    *   Treat infrastructure code like application code.
    *   Use branching and PRs for infrastructure changes.
    *   Implement code review for infrastructure code.
    *   Automate infrastructure deployments using CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Store secrets securely (e.g., using environment variables or secrets management tools).

### 5. CI/CD Integration

*   **DevOps Use Case:** Automating builds, tests, and deployments.
*   **Git's Role:**
    *   Triggers CI/CD pipelines on code pushes or PR merges.
    *   Provides a clear history of changes for auditing and rollbacks.
    *   Enables automated testing and validation of code and infrastructure changes.

## Advanced Git Concepts (Optional, but helpful for advanced DevOps roles)

*   **Git Hooks:** Scripts that run automatically before or after certain Git events (e.g., commit, push).
    *   Can be used for code quality checks, security audits, and automated tasks.
*   **Submodules and Subtrees:** Managing dependencies and external projects within a repository.
*   **Interactive Staging:** Using `git add -p` to selectively stage changes.
*   **Git Rebase:** An alternative way to integrate changes (use with caution on shared branches).
*   **Bisect:** A powerful tool for finding the commit that introduced a bug.

## Best Practices for Collaboration

*   **Pull Requests:** Use PRs for code review and discussion.
*   **Code Review:** Provide constructive feedback and ensure code quality.
*   **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages.
*   **Frequent Commits:** Commit small, logical changes.
*   **Branching Strategy:** Choose a branching strategy that suits your team's needs (Gitflow, GitHub Flow, etc.).
*   **Communication:** Communicate effectively with your team members about changes and plans.
